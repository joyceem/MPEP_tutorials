# Divergence Time Estimation I
## Calibration assessment
Elizabeth M. Joyce 

In pairs, read your assigned [fossil papers](https://moodle.lmu.de/mod/folder/view.php?id=2106815). Using information available from literature online and information presented in the paper, fill in the table [Fossil_Scoring_Template.xlsx](https://moodle.lmu.de/mod/resource/view.php?id=2106818) to assess whether your fossil/s are suitable for calibrating nodes. If suitable, decide which node of the phylogenetic tree you would calibrate this fossil with, and with what settings (age, prior distribution).

Prepare a short (c. 5-10 min) presentation outlining the fossil and its suitability for dating, to discuss with the class why you would or would not use this fossil for dating.
